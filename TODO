window.cpp: constructor - WindowHints make the window undrawable.
window.cpp: Run - instead of creating a callback, we check it manaully. Maybe make a Channel class to send from the callback to the X object (as generic as possible).

opengl_wrapper.cpp: RenderText - put text in the middle of the rectangle.
